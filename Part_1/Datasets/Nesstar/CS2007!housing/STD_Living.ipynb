    "## **Intoduction**\n",
    "We live in a beautiful diverse country. A country with beautiful people who get along and fight here and there, a country of great people who understand their differences to those they live with. A country where not everything is perfect but things could be better. In a country where people are either competing, getting by or barely surving day by day. We live in a very beautiful diverse country where people have different standards of living. Where standard of living is measured by what they have and what they are able to afford and what independant variables some are exposed to that others do not . In this Project we aim to identify major contributors to the standard of living of south africans through a survey that was done nationally with a sample of approximately quarter of a million instance of people, where an instance is a household of either an individual or a family.\n",

    "#### **Research question**\n",
    "What are the factors that are affecting the South Africans' standard of living?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Hypothesis**\n",
    "To answer the question we look at factors like the types of homes and facilities that people living in and ease of access to certain things and scarsity of certain things to different families and individuals. From there we then make in inference as to what is the dominating in the contribution to the standard of living in South Africa. Before we begin, we have a hypothesis, that mojority of South Africans are living a normal standard of life, there's way lesser rich people and and the there are those who are poor whose numbers are more than those that are rich and therefore things like location and availability of resources are major contributers to the standard of living.\n",
